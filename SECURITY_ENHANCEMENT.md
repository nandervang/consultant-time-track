# 🔒 Enhanced Security for Sensitive Documents

## The Problem You Identified

As a single-user system, if your account or database gets compromised, the current `is_sensitive` flag alone won't protect your sensitive data. You were absolutely right to be concerned!

## What I've Implemented

### 🛡️ **Client-Side Encryption**
- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Military-grade encryption using Web Crypto API
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: Your password becomes a strong encryption key using 100,000 iterations
- **Unique Salt & IV**: Each encrypted document has unique salt and initialization vector
- **Zero-Knowledge**: The database never sees your encryption password or decrypted content

### 🔑 **How It Works**

1. **When you mark a document as sensitive:**
   - You're prompted to set/enter a master encryption password
   - The document content is encrypted client-side (in your browser)
   - Only the encrypted data is stored in the database
   - The original content is wiped from memory

2. **When viewing sensitive documents:**
   - You need to unlock with your master password
   - Content is decrypted client-side
   - Password is cached for 30 minutes for convenience

3. **If someone compromises your database:**
   - They see only encrypted gibberish
   - Without your master password, the content is mathematically unrecoverable
   - Even you can't recover it without the password!

## 🔐 **Security Features**

### **Strong Encryption**
- **AES-256-GCM**: Same encryption used by governments
- **PBKDF2**: Protects against rainbow table attacks
- **Cryptographically Secure**: Uses browser's native Web Crypto API

### **Password Requirements**
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, and numbers
- Auto-generation available for maximum security

### **Session Management**
- Password cached for 30 minutes
- Auto-expires for security
- Can be manually cleared
- Extends automatically on activity

### **Data Protection**
- **Database**: Only encrypted content stored
- **Memory**: Plaintext cleared after encryption
- **Transfer**: Encrypted data travels over HTTPS
- **Integrity**: Built-in tamper detection

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **For New Sensitive Documents:**
1. Create document normally
2. Toggle "Sensitive Document" 
3. System prompts for master password (first time)
4. Document is encrypted and saved

### **For Viewing Sensitive Documents:**
1. Click on a sensitive document (🔒 icon)
2. Enter master password if session expired
3. Content decrypts and displays normally

### **Password Management:**
- Use the auto-generated secure passwords
- Store your master password in a password manager
- **WARNING**: If you lose the master password, encrypted documents are permanently lost!

## ⚠️ **Important Security Notes**

### **Do's:**
✅ Use a strong, unique master password  
✅ Store the password in a password manager  
✅ Use the auto-generate feature for maximum security  
✅ Keep your browser updated  
✅ Clear encryption session when done  

### **Don'ts:**
❌ Don't share your master password  
❌ Don't use weak passwords  
❌ Don't rely on browser password storage for the master password  
❌ Don't ignore password strength warnings  

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Encryption Process:**
```
Your Content → JSON → AES-GCM Encrypt → Base64 → Database
     ↑                     ↑
Master Password → PBKDF2 → Encryption Key
```

### **Decryption Process:**
```
Database → Base64 → AES-GCM Decrypt → JSON → Your Content
                        ↑
Master Password → PBKDF2 → Decryption Key
```

### **Database Storage:**
```sql
client_documents (
  id,
  title,                    -- ✅ Visible (not sensitive)
  content,                  -- ❌ Empty for sensitive docs
  encrypted_content,        -- 🔒 Encrypted blob
  is_sensitive,             -- ✅ Visible (security flag)
  ...
)
```

## 🎯 **Security Level Achieved**

### **Before Enhancement:**
- 🟡 **Basic**: Visual indicators only
- 🟡 **Database Compromise**: All data readable
- 🟡 **Account Takeover**: All data accessible

### **After Enhancement:**
- 🟢 **Military-Grade**: AES-256-GCM encryption
- 🟢 **Database Compromise**: Sensitive data protected
- 🟢 **Account Takeover**: Master password still required
- 🟢 **Zero-Knowledge**: Even you can't recover without password

## 🔄 **Migration Strategy**

The enhancement is **backward compatible**:
- Existing documents work as before
- New sensitive documents get encrypted
- Users opt-in to encryption per document
- No existing data is affected

## 🚨 **Emergency Recovery**

**If you forget your master password:**
- Encrypted documents become permanently inaccessible
- You can still create new documents
- Consider keeping a secure backup of the password
- System will warn you about this during setup

Your consultant time-tracking system now has **bank-level security** for sensitive client information! 🎉
